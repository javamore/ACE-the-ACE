Virtualized data centers brought you infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offerings. IaaS offerings provide you with raw compute, storage, and network, organized in ways familiar to you from physical and virtualized data centers. PaaS offerings, on the other hand, bind your code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure your application needs, thus allow you to focus on your application logic. In the IaaS model, you pay for what you allocate. In the PaaS model, you pay for what you use. As cloud computing has evolved, the momentum has shifted toward managed infrastructure and managed services. 



Billing

Google was the first major cloud provider to deliver per-second billing for its Infrastructure-as-a-Service compute offering, Google Compute Engine. Per-second billing is offered for users of Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine (container infrastructure as a service), Cloud Dataproc (the open-source Big Data system Hadoop as a service), and App Engine flexible environment VMs (a Platform as a Service). 

Google Compute Engine offers automatically applied sustained-use discounts, which are automatic discounts that you get for running a virtual-machine instance for a significant portion of the billing month. Specifically, when you run an instance for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically gives you a discount for every incremental minute you use for that instance. 

Custom virtual machine types allow Google Compute Engine virtual machines to be fine-tuned for their applications, so that you can tailor your pricing for your workloads.
