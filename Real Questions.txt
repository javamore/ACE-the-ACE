Q1. 
Every employee of your company has a Google account. Your operational team needs to manage a large number of instances on Compute Engine. Each member of this team needs only administrative access to the servers. Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is operationally efficient and must be able to determine who accessed a given instance. What should you do?

A. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.
B. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.
C. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their Google account. Grant the ג€compute.osAdminLoginג€ role to the Google group corresponding to this team.
D. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.

My choice is C.
Reason: Some would choose D, but D is hard to "determine who accessed a given instance", and sending private keys to users is not safe, more details see this website: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access.

Q2.
You need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet. The subnet's range must be as large as possible. Which range should you use?
A. 0.0.0.0/0
B. 10.0.0.0/8
C. 172.16.0.0/12
D. 192.168.0.0/16

My choice is B.
Reason:The private network range is defined by IETF (Ref: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) and adhered to by all cloud providers. The supported internal IP Address ranges are 
1. 24-bit block 10.0.0.0/8 (16777216 IP Addresses)
2. 20-bit block 172.16.0.0/12 (1048576 IP Addresses)
3. 16-bit block 192.168.0.0/16 (65536 IP Addresses)
10.0.0.0/8 gives you the most extensive range - 16777216 IP Addresses.
